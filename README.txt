Server and Client need to be started seperat, the server doesnt route to the angular frontend.
The npmstart.bat script does start both applications.

Add mood tool due to IBM workshop. Had to change structure.

Note:
Firefox doesn't scroll chat. 
//easy fix but sacrifices chat messages showing up bottom to top
